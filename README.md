## **Auto Clicker** ([autoclicker.js](//github.com/HellMarr/OnePieceClicker-scripts/blob/main/autoclicker.js)) 
This script make up to 1000 clicks per second on the islands and dungeons<br>

## **Auto Training** ([autoclicker.js](//github.com/HellMarr/OnePieceClicker-scripts/blob/main/autotraining.js)) 
This script removes and add new cards on the training slots. It always takes a random card out of the 3 first available, so don't forget to sort them by level ascending<br>
Make sure to keep your mouse on the page, and to open the training page, otherwise it will not work <br>
